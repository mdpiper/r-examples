# r-examples

A collection of examples of programming in R.

Also:

* My [R notes](https://github.com/mdpiper/knowledge/blob/main/R.md) provide additional information
* I learned much from the [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html) book
* I also learned from the Earth Data Analytics [online course](https://earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/)
