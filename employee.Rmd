This document provides examples of how to use the `Employee` R6 class defined in `employee.R`.

Load the `employee.R` script to access the `Employee` class.
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
source('person.R')
source('employee.R')
```

Create a new `Employee` object and display its details using an implied call to the `$print` method.
```{r example-usage}
alice <- Employee$new("Alice", age=28, position="Data Scientist", salary=90000)
alice
```
